G.ulasch I.nteractive F.ahrplan T.ools
<-==================================->
The G.I.F.T is a set of simple Fahrplan maintainig and anouncment tools.
It consists of mostly three programms:
1. the server:   He collects all events and distribute these among
                 the clients and anouncers. He also keeps track of 
	         the event so that non of them overlap.
2. the client:   He commits events and changes to the server.
	         He also displays all events.
3. the anouncer: He displays the next events to the public.

== Usage (Server) ==

 * Extract the server binary and the data/ files somewhere
 * Configure the username/password pairs in data/server.cnf
   Note that the credentials are transmitted as plain text, so 
   do not use valuabe passwords.
 * Run the server (./server). It does not fork, so you might want
   to run it in a screen session.

== Usage (Client) ==
 * Extract the client binary and the data/ files somewhere
 * Configure username/password, hostname and port of the server
   in data/client.cnf
 * Run the client (./client)
 * To edit an event, just click the field and change the value.
   ENTER will upload the change, ESC will abort the modification.
   Note that the program expects correct entries for Room, Time and RunTime
 * To delete an event, select the row and click Delete.
 * To add an event, use the last, empty line. First enter the name
   of the event, then the Time, RunTime and Room.

== Usage (Anounce) ==
 * Extract the client binary and the data/ files somewhere
 * Configure username/password, hostname and port of the server
   in data/client.cnf
 * Run the client (./client)
 * Clicking anywhere exits the program.
