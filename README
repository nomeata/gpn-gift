<-==================================->
The G.I.F.T is a set of simple Fahrplan maintainig and anouncment tools.
It consists of mostly three programms:
1. the server:   He collects all events and distribute these among
                 the clients and anouncers. He also keeps track of 
	         the event so that non of them overlap.
2. the client:   He commits events and changes to the server.
	         He also displays all events.
3. the anouncer: He displays the next events to the public.
